Future tasks:
Difficulty settings (rule set checkboxes)
Roguelike mode with random trainers, random items, random pokemon
  Think of this as pokemon slay the spire. You do a battle, you earn potential items and/or routes, could have a shop, could do have events, could have elites (rival fights) that give greater rewards. End each section of the game with a boss battle (gym leader). Pokemon deaths are permanent. Heart scales as extra special items. For items and routes, you can choose which one you would like to unlock. Battles could be chosen from pools of appropriate level battles (based on level of pokemon which is only leveled up after battles).
Traditional nuzlocke campaign mode: Follow a pre-programmed campaign like renegade platinum. Just serves as a streamlined version of renegade platinum
Implement pokemon showdown battle code
  Make UI
Program opponent AI
Limit access to Fishing or Surfing encounters until that rod is unlocked or surfing is achieved.
Ability to calculate battle interactions like move damage both in-battle (checking out what move you should use) and when planning and editing your party. Check the damage each of one’s pokemon’s moves do to an opponent pokemon, and vice versa.
Ability to turn off opponent preview. 
Ability to load in a specific battle. Use case is nuzlockers using this tool to practice a battle. 
Ability to allow players to create challenge runs in-game for others to fight against. Or at least program via text files in folder.
Goal: Make catching and battling just as dramatic as they can be when playing nuzlocke on cart.
Implement hardcores nuzlocke rules
Implement “heart scales equivalent; Some way to change pokemon’s IVs or Natures.A rare reward.
Make wheel more satisfying (stop working on this; Make the thing functional, then make it pretty)
  Sound effects on spin + win
  Hover tooltips showing stats or type icons
  Fix borders being seen behind yellow bars.
Make Hub screen (replace current main menu; need to have a different start screen for when you boot up the game
